## This Document contian complete work of Reproducible Research Asssessment 1;

##Loading and Preparing data;

```{r}
getwd()
mydata<- read.csv("C:/Users/sk_mi/Desktop/Coursera/Reproducible Research/week 2/repdata%2Fdata%2Factivity/activity.csv")
str(mydata)
head(mydata)
tail(mydata)
```
![plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-1](figure/unnamed-chunk-1.png) 

## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?;

```{r}
steps_perday<- aggregate(steps~date, mydata, sum)
hist(steps_perday$steps, main = "Steps Taken Per day", xlab = "Steps", col = "blue", breaks = 8)
```
![plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-2](figure/unnamed-chunk-2.png) 

## Let's find the mean and median of the total no of steps;

```{r}
meansteps_perday<- mean(steps_perday$steps)
mediansteps_perday<- median(steps_perday$steps)
print(meansteps_perday)
print(mediansteps_perday)
```
![plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-3](figure/unnamed-chunk-3.png) 

### Note: As we can see mean and median are both pretty much close to each other, this is how we can sense the average value of mydata.

## What is the average daily activity pattern?;
### by anwering this question, we will accomplished two below statement;
* We will make a time series plot of the 5-minute interval (x-axis) and the average number of steps taken, averaged across all days (y-axis)
*Which 5-minute interval, on average across all the days in the dataset, contains the maximum number of steps?

```{r}
steps_interval<- aggregate(steps ~ interval, mydata, mean)
plot(steps_interval$interval, steps_interval$steps, type="l", xlab = "5 min - interval", ylab = "Average steps", main = "Average Daily Activity Pattern", col = "blue")
steps_interval$interval[which.max(steps_interval$steps)]
```

##  Imputing missing values;
Note that there are a number of days/intervals where there are missing values (coded as NA). The presence of missing days may introduce bias into some calculations or summaries of the data.

### We will calculate the total number of missing values in the dataset;
```{r}
nrow(mydata[is.na(mydata$steps),])
```
![plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-5](figure/unnamed-chunk-5.png) 

### Now we will devise a "strategy" for filling in all of the missing values in the dataset;
```{r}
newdata_withoutNAs<- mydata
newdata_withoutNAs[is.na(newdata_withoutNAs$steps), "steps"]<- 0 ## Putting na = 0
```

As we have already replaced NA with numeric data 0;

### Now will create histogram of the total number of steps taken each day;

```{r}
steps_perday_withoutNAs<- aggregate(steps ~ date, newdata_withoutNAs, sum)

hist(steps_perday_withoutNAs$steps, main = "Total Steps Per Day", xlab = "Steps", col = "grey", breaks = 10)
```
![plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-6](figure/unnamed-chunk-6.png) 
### and Calculate and report the mean and median total number of steps taken per day;

```{r}
meansteps_perday_withoutNAs<- mean(steps_perday_withoutNAs$steps)
mediansteps_perday_withoutNAs<- median(steps_perday_withoutNAs$steps)
print(meansteps_perday_withoutNAs)  # mean
print(mediansteps_perday_withoutNAs)  # median
```
![plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-7](figure/unnamed-chunk-7.png) 

The mean and the median are now almost the same after replacing missing values with the mean value for the relevant interval. It makes sense that the median value would now move closer to the mean. So the Median value increased after this method of missing value replacement.

##  Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?;
Now we are going to create a new factor variable in the dataset with two levels - "weekday" and "weekend" indicating whether a given date is a weekday or weekend day.

```{r}
newdata_withoutNAs$day=ifelse(as.POSIXlt(as.Date(newdata_withoutNAs$date))$wday%%6==0,"weekend","weekday")
newdata_withoutNAs$daytype=factor(newdata_withoutNAs$day,levels=c("weekday","weekend"))
```

### finally now will create a panel plot containing a time series plot (i.e. type = "l") of the 5-minute interval (x-axis) and the average number of steps taken, averaged across all weekday days or weekend days (y-axis).;

```{r}
stepsInterval2=aggregate(steps~interval+day,newdata_withoutNAs,mean)
library(lattice)
xyplot(steps~interval|factor(day),data=stepsInterval2,aspect=1/2,type="l")
```
